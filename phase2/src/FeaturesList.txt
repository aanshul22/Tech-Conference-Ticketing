-- LIST OF FEATURES --
Here is a list of all the additional features we have implemented for Phase 2. Please let us know if you have questions
about any of them!

General features:
    - GUI
    - JSON files containing details about users, messages, rooms, and events
    - Clicking on the word "Speakers" in the event information section, the user is able to see the full list of
    speakers in a pop-up window.

Organizer:
    - Organizers modify a scheduled event's speakers (add or remove), maximum capacity, and room if they click on
    "Modify Speakers" and "Edit Event" respectively on the "Modify Events" tab of the menu. They can also remove the
    event.
    - By clicking on the "Announcements" tab, organizers can send an announcement to either admins, organizers, speakers,
    attendees, or all of the aforementioned groups.
    - Organizers can create admin, attendee, organizer, or speaker accounts under the "Create Accounts" page.
    - When creating an event under "Create Event", organizers can specify any time & duration in the future, maximum
    capacity of the event (with the restriction that it does not exceed the capacity of the room it occurs in), and
    optionally speakers to participate in the event.
    - For room and account creation, organizers can check name availability.

Speaker:
    - Clicking on "My Talks" on the speaker menu, speakers can view the events (and event details) that they are
    speaking at. By selecting "Message Attendees", a speaker can also send a message to all the attendees signed up for
    the event.

    - Admins can delete any scheduled event by selecting it on the "Delete Events" page.
    - They can also delete the chat history between any two users under the "Delete Chats" section.
